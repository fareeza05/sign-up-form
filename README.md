# Sign Up Form
---

## About
---
A website with an interface which is meant to allow users to sign up by entering their information.

Live Website : https://fareeza05.github.io/sign-up-form/

## Features
---
* Interface utilizes flexbox for a sleek look
* Input fields have input validators to check whether or not data is of correct format, and whether a required field is left blank. Unique error messages are displayed accordingly right below respective fields

## Future Improvements
---
* Add functionality to the sign-in button, and animations after it is clicked.
* Add a day-mode / night-mode switch button which will change the website's look after being pressed.
* Bugs to fix - none thus far
* More TBA...

## Concepts Learned
---
* Event listeners and event handling with Javascript
* DOM Manipulation
* Using Javascript ternary operators and regular expressions for the input validations for cleaner and condensed code implementation

## More concepts to learn and implement
---
* Cross-browser compatibility 
* Switching classes

## Conclusion 
---
This project has been an interesting learning experience as it is my first time extensively working with ternary operators, and also the different input characteristics. I hope to revisit this project and make further improvements and iterations of this website in order to add the additional features listed above.
